3. =git clone  https://github.com/ndvanforeest/emacs.git=

   on the first launch.)

* General information on emacs

I learned a lot about emacs from the following sites

- [[https://sachachua.com/blog/emacs/][Sacha Chua]] Here you can find
  many useful posts and subscribe to the extremely useful emacs weekly
  newsletter.
- [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/][Mastering Emacs]]. A really nice
  book about emacs.
- [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsNewbieHelpReference][Emacs wiki]]
- http://pragmaticemacs.com/
- https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs
- [[https://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs/][CestlaZ]] A series of youtube movies by Mike Zamansky on how to work with and configure emacs.
 He gives many useful suggestions. 
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/pdf/eintr.pdf][Chassel]] An introduction to programming in elisp

* My own init.el
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: my-own-init.el
  :END:

I only use org-mode, latex, python, and git (and sometimes plain txt).
I think I optimized my init.el for this, and I stripped all the rest.

I decided to not tinker with the  standard emacs key bindings;  over the years I have noticed that they are mostly very well thought-out, and, perhaps more importantly, they don't change.
