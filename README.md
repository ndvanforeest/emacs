#  General information on emacs 

I learned a lot about emacs from the following sites

- [Sacha Chua](https://sachachua.com/blog/emacs/) Here you can find many useful posts and subscribe to the extremely useful emacs weekly newsletter.
- [Mastering Emacs](https://www.masteringemacs.org/). A really nice book about emacs. 
- [Emacs help](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsNewbieHelpReference)

# My own init.el

I only use latex, python, and git (and sometimes plain txt).
I think I optimized my init.el for this, and I stripped all the rest.
I also just learned the standard emacs key bindings, because over the years I have noticed that they are very well thought-out, and, perhaps more importantly, they don't change.
So, it's LOFN, i.e., learn once, forget never (which is in stark contrast with a PhD thesis, as that is WORN, i.e., write once, read never).
