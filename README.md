# Installing Emacs

1. Close Emacs.
2. Delete `~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d`, if you already have it.
3. Run `git clone  https://github.com/ndvanforeest/emacs.git`
4. Open Emacs, it will download all the packages. (Ignore the warnings on the first launch.)
5. Start using it! :tada:

# My own init.el

I only use latex, python, and git (and sometimes plain txt).
I think I optimized my init.el for this, and I stripped all the rest.
I also just learned the standard emacs key bindings, beacause over the years I have noticed that they are very well thought-out, and, perhaps more importantly, they don't change. So, it's LOFN (learn once, forget never), which is in contrast with a PhD thesis; that is WORN (write once, read never).
